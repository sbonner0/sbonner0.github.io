Hi, I’m Stephen Bonner — a machine learning researcher currently working in pre-clinical drug discovery at AstraZeneca (Views expressed here are my own and do not represent my employer). I’m particularly interested in LLMs for scientific usecases, GPU performance, open-source software, and Linux-based systems. This blog is a place to document experiments, deep-dives, and lessons learned—especially when things don’t go quite as planned.

Outside of work, I enjoy cycling, skiing, photography, and tinkering with hardware and home lab setups - these topics may occasionally feature here as well.

Please feel free to contact me on [Linkedin](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/stephen-bonner-ml).
