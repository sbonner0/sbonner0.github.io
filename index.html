      Hi, I'm Stephen Bonner — a machine learning researcher currently working in 
      pre-clinical drug discovery at AstraZeneca. I'm particularly interested in 
      LLMs for scientific usecases, GPU performance, open-source software, and 
      Linux-based systems. This blog documents experiments, deep-dives, and lessons 
      learned—especially when things don't go quite as planned.
